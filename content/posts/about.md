  Born profoundly deaf, Sophie wears two cochlear implants to hear and speak. Though Sophie speaks fluently and hears very well, she also learned Auslan (Australian Sign Language) six years ago when she started volunteering to mentor deaf and hard of hearing youth in Australia. Fast-track to 2018, this was the year when Sophie realised the power of code by joining [Le Wagon](https://www.lewagon.com/) in making a positive difference in deaf people's lives.
  <br>
  <br>
  She has now created [SignHow](https://www.signhow.co/), a global sign language dictionary that hosts over 300 different sign languages in 196 countries. This website is the first to support crowd-sourcing and allow users to view signs using GIFs, which are more efficient than videos. It was developed by a LeWagon team where she was Project Manager assisting a Leading Developer and 3 developers.
