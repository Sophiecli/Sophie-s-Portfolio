  Highly experienced in online media marketing and project management, Sophie was often frustrated in how limited opportunities were for deaf people in Australia and globally.
  <br>
  Sophie took the plunge to move to Shanghai to venture into entrepreneurship and realised the power of code in shaping the future - especially in accessibility. She decided to join Le Wagon's 9 week coding bootcamp and has not looked back since!
