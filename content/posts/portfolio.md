_This product was created in the last 10 day product sprint at Le Wagon 2018. This was designed in response to the increasing shortage of hearing interpreters available for deaf people in emergencies. 70% of deaf people (50 million) cannot read or write due to lack of access to basic education, hence the urgent need for interpreters._
